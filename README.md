# AWS Data Engineering Project

In this project, I focused on learning Amazon Web Services (AWS) and explored several key services commonly used by Data Engineers, including **IAM (Identity and Access Management), **S3, **Glue, **Crawler, **Athena, and **QuickSight. Using real data, I built a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline.

Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience in data storage, transformation, and querying, and documented my learning journey to help others who are starting their own path in AWS Data Engineering.

I've also created a video to share my experience and guide others through the process.
